Kelly's approach fosters better efficiency, mental well-being, and a deeper connection to nature, tailored to each client's unique needs.



Kelly Sunshine brings together her passions for land, food, and community through a unique blend of teaching, culinary arts, and regenerative design. Over the past decade, she has cultivated expertise at the intersection of ecological literacy, community resilience, and hands-on creativity.

As founder of The Sunshine Collective, Kelly leads a mission-driven education and permaculture business that helps people forge meaningful connections with the land. Through landscape design consulting, workshops, and her growing native plant nursery, she provides regenerative solutions for land stewards and communities, with a focus on soil health, ecosystem repair, and finding self-care through nature connection.

Kelly's collaborative approach was evident in her co-founding of the Soul & Soil Project, where she helped create immersive community experiences centered on food justice, youth empowerment, and ecological stewardship. She continues this mentorship approach in her current work with Sullivan Foundation students, guiding the next generation of changemakers through entrepreneurship, creativity, and place-based leadership.

Her culinary background as a chef and educator remains central to her practice, emphasizing farm-to-table growing, seasonal ingredients, and the art of foraging. Kelly's food philosophy reflects her earth-based values: use what's abundant, honor the seasons, and build connection through shared nourishment—whether the ingredients are wild-foraged or grown just steps from the kitchen.

Through all her work, Kelly demonstrates that regenerative living isn't just about healing the land—it's about creating joyful, sustainable ways for people and communities to thrive together.

OUR MISSION IS TO CREATE BETTER REGENERATIVE LIFE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS BY BETTER SUPPORTING BIODIVERSITY IN ECOSYSTEMS AND EMPOWERING PEOPLE TO DEEPEN THEIR CONNECTION TO NATURE & THE LAND THROUGH HANDS-ON ACTION



Winter Season Home Services

zone 0

Permaculture is a holistic approach to creating sustainable and regenerative systems by mimicking natural ecosystems. It integrates land, resources, people, and the environment through practices that support resilience and ecological balance. Central to permaculture is the concept of zones, which organize space based on frequency of use and interaction, with Zone 0 representing the home and inner self, extending outward to Zone 5, which is left wild to foster biodiversity and natural processes. With winter approaching, we’re offering a winter season home services, which we call Zone 0 – the home.
