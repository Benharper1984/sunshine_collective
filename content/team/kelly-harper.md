Kelly Harper is the heart and soul behind The Sunshine Collective. With over 8 years of experience in wellness coaching and personal development, Kelly has dedicated her life to helping others discover their inner light and create meaningful, purposeful lives.

## My Journey

After experiencing her own transformational healing journey through mindfulness and holistic wellness practices, Kelly felt called to share these life-changing tools with others. She combines evidence-based coaching techniques with intuitive wisdom to create a safe, supportive space for deep personal growth.

## My Approach

Kelly believes that every person has an innate capacity for healing, growth, and joy. Her coaching style is warm, intuitive, and deeply supportive, meeting each client exactly where they are on their unique journey. She specializes in:

- **Mindful Life Transitions** - Navigating career changes, relationships, and life shifts with clarity and confidence
- **Stress & Anxiety Management** - Developing practical tools for emotional regulation and inner peace
- **Purpose & Passion Discovery** - Uncovering your authentic path and creating aligned action steps
- **Holistic Wellness Integration** - Balancing mind, body, and spirit for sustainable well-being

## Training & Certifications

Kelly's extensive training includes certifications from the International Coach Federation (ICF), completion of Jon Kabat-Zinn's Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program, and advanced studies in energy healing modalities. She continues to deepen her practice through ongoing education and personal development work.

When she's not coaching, Kelly can be found hiking in nature, practicing yoga, or curled up with a good book and her rescue dog, Sunshine - the original inspiration for The Sunshine Collective's name.
